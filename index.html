			<p>As ‘at home learning’ became the standard in 2020, with over <a href="https://nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/">9 million public school students</a> experiencing home schooling during that year.  </p>
			<p> As the country heads into a new presidency that vows to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2024/11/25/republican-states-back-trump-plan-abolish-education-dept">disband the Department of Education</a>, let's see how public school students are recovering 2 years after learning without full access to public school resources.</p>
			<p>The ways landlords discrimination ranges from ghosting, administrative issues on the government’s end, or an outright  “no voucher accepted” rejection. </p>

        	<p>In 2022 the first post pandemic literacy and reading comprehension scores were recorded showing significant drops across almost all 50 states. The worst being a ten point drop in reading comprehension in Virginia while the highest increase was two points in Louisiana.  </p>
			<p>Parents blame the state for the lack of support and resources, Melissa David who had to become a first time homeschool teacher recalled, “I’m blessed that I could stay home and teach my son even if I didn't know how, many parent couldn’t afford to do that and what other options did those parents have when schools were closed?”.</p>
			<p>As Trump begins his term his threats on the department of education become more and more real, Jennifer Fuentes points out, “Even under Democratic Presidents public schools and education are an afterthought. If we really care about the future of our youth we would be investing in these skills, not ignoring them.”</p>
